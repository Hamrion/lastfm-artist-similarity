# lastfm-artist-similarity


**"lastfm-artist-similarity"** is a Python script that uses the **Last.fm API** to find similar artists based on a given artist name. The script authenticates with the Last.fm APIs using your API credential, takes the artist name you provide, and suggests 10 similar artists. The script also prints the names, similarity rates, and genres of the 10 artists provided for your reference on the console. With this script, you can get 10 different artist suggestions similar to your favorite artist and expand your artist archive.



## Requirements


1. **Python:** This code is written in Python, so you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Last.fm API credentials:** To authenticate with the **Last.fm API**, you will need to obtain an `api_key`, `api_secret`, `username`, and `password_hash` from the **Last.fm Developer Website**. You can create a **Last.fm Developer account** and obtain these credentials by following the instructions here: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
